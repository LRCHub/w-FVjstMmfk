[00:12.78] Wrapped up in some powdered wool
[00:16.95] I guess I'm losing touch
[00:19.03] Don't tell me this is dying
[00:20.37] 'Cos I ain't changed that much
[00:35.37] 
[00:22.97] The only sound is water drops
[00:25.65] I wonder where the hell I am
[00:28.06] Some kind of jam?
[00:36.56] 
[00:29.86] Cuckoo Cocoon have I come to
[00:32.25] Too soon for you?
[00:40.75] 
[00:37.26] There's nothing I can recognize
[00:39.32] This is nowhere that I've known
[00:41.79] With no sign of life at all
[00:44.63] I guess that I'm alone
[00:55.63] 
[00:47.55] And I feel so secure
[00:50.14] That I know this can't be real
[00:52.88] But I feel good
[01:00.38] 
[00:54.93] Cuckoo cocoon have I come to
[00:59.12] Too soon for you?
[01:07.62] 
[01:24.64] I wonder if I'm a prisoner
[01:27.60] Locked up in some Brooklyn jail
[01:30.48] Or some sort of Jonah
[01:33.37] Shut up inside the whale
[01:45.37] 
[01:36.12] No, I'm still Rael
[01:38.93] And I'm stuck in some kind of cage
[01:41.62] What could've saved me?
[01:53.12] 
[01:43.81] Cuckoo cocoon have I come to
[01:46.89] Too soon for you?
