It happens when you can't take anymore... (anymore)
And you don't want to fight
You go inside yourself... (deep inside yourself)

()
Sheltered in this cocoon
I will break the skin
I'm not afraid
I will be a butterfly

The change happens when dormant emotions... (emotions)
Overwhelm you and your will to live... (will to live)
Rocking back and forth holding yourself... (hold yourself)
You make a promise to stay inside ... (stay inside)

Sheltered in this cocoon
I will break the skin
I'm not afraid
I will be a butterfly

Don't
Be
Afraid
To
Fly

The holes in your wings
Make you beautiful
They will make you strong
Won't speed you to the ground

The holes in your wings
They will make you strong
They will make you beautiful
Won't speed you to the ground
